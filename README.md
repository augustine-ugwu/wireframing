# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a crucial step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. It involves creating low-fidelity visual representations of a webpage or application layout. These blueprints help designers, developers, and stakeholders understand the structure and flow of a product before any actual design or development begins.

## Importance of Wireframing in Design

- **Clarifies Design Ideas**: Wireframes allow teams to visualize the skeletal structure of an interface, making it easier to discuss and refine design ideas.
- **Improves User Experience**: Early focus on layout and navigation helps ensure a logical and user-friendly experience.
- **Saves Time and Cost**: Detecting issues early in the wireframe stage reduces the need for expensive revisions during later development.
- **Enhances Collaboration**: Wireframes serve as a communication tool between designers, developers, and clients, ensuring everyone is aligned.
